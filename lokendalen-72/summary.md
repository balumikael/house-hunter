## Condition Report — Issues to Watch ⚠️

### TG2 (Significant Deviations — Moderate Concern)

| Area | Issue |
|------|-------|
| **Roof covering** | Moisture marks on underside roof boards. Moisture tests showed normal values, but ongoing monitoring in rain recommended. |
| **Gutters & flashings** | No snow guards on full roof (not required when built, but risk of snow/ice falling). Gutters/downpipes aging — replacement needed eventually. |
| **Wall cladding** | Missing air gap at bottom of cladding — reduces ventilation behind panels, increasing moisture risk. Also: fasteners driven too deep, creating water-trapping depressions. |
| **Attic/roof structure** | Mold growth on underside of roof. Condensation symptoms detected. Elevated moisture readings in timber. Limited ventilation — needs investigation and remediation. |
| **Windows** | Past half of expected lifespan — higher heat loss, increased maintenance. Replacement needed eventually. |
| **Doors** | Past half of expected lifespan — same as windows. |
| **Terrace/balcony** | Railing does NOT meet building code requirements (not even the code from when it was built). Railing is loose — tighten for safety. |
| **Below-ground rooms** | Lined with organic materials (wood/gypsum) — risk construction for moisture. Damage often hidden. |
| **Interior stairs** | Railing height below current 0.9m requirement. Handrail is loose — tighten for safety. |
| **Interior doors** | Some doors rub against frames — need adjustment. |
| **Water pipes** | Corrosion on some pipes and manifolds. Pipes past half of expected lifespan — replacement needed eventually. |
| **Drain pipes** | Past half of expected lifespan — increased leak risk. |
| **Ventilation** | No air gap under doors to bathroom and laundry room — limits airflow, causes moisture buildup. |
| **Electrical system** | Simplified inspection only — may have undetected faults. Full inspection recommended. |
| **Drainage** | Foundation membrane ends above grade (should be 5cm below). Drainage system past half of expected lifespan. |
| **Foundation walls** | Diagonal cracks observed — may indicate uneven settling. Monitor for development. |
| **Terrain grading** | Insufficient slope away from foundation (<1:50 over 3m) — water may pool against walls. Grading adjustment recommended. |
| **Toilet room** | Inadequate ventilation; sanitaryware past half lifespan; creaking floor. |
| **Laundry room** | Surfaces, floor, and membrane past half lifespan. Floor drain height insufficient (<25mm). No membrane documentation. Fixtures aging. No door ventilation gap. |

### TG3 (Serious Deviations — Critical!) 🔴

| Area | Issue |
|------|-------|
| **Fire safety equipment** | Fire extinguisher older than 10 years — **must be replaced** per fire prevention regulations. |
| **Bathroom (lower floor)** | **MAJOR — needs full renovation.** Multiple serious issues: mold in grout, cracked tiles, cracked grout, tiles with hollow sound (poor adhesion), counter-slope (water flows away from drain), insufficient drain slope, water pooling, swelling in bathroom furniture, aging fixtures, no door ventilation gap, no membrane documentation, membrane past half lifespan. |

## 🔴 Red / Yellow Flags

1. **Bathroom needs FULL renovation (TG3)** — multiple serious defects: cracked tiles, mold, counter-slope, poor drainage, no membrane documentation. This is a significant cost (~200,000–400,000+ NOK).
2. **Fire extinguisher expired (TG3)** — must be replaced immediately (minor cost but legally required).
3. **Attic/roof structure has mold, condensation, and elevated moisture** — ventilation issues need investigation and remediation. Could become expensive.
4. **Storm "Hans" water damage (2023)** — floors and walls were replaced in lower floor. Repairs done professionally (Belfor/Gjensidige), but worth verifying long-term dryness.
5. **Foundation has diagonal cracks** — may indicate uneven settling. Marine clay area with "very high" probability — foundation concerns are real.
6. **Terrain slopes toward house** — water can pool against foundation. Grading needs correction.
7. **Drainage system past half lifespan** — future replacement cost.
8. **Wall cladding lacks proper air gap** — hidden moisture risk behind panels.
9. **No radon measurement** — area has moderate/low risk but basement bedrooms warrant testing.
10. **Silverfish present** — cosmetic nuisance but worth noting.
11. **Below-ground bedrooms are risk construction** for moisture (organic materials in contact with ground).
12. **Terrace railing doesn't meet code** and is loose — safety issue, especially with children.
13. **Interior stair railing too low and loose** — another safety concern.
14. **Windows and doors past half lifespan** — eventual replacement cost.
15. **Living room ceiling height 2.37m** — below the 2.40m code minimum.
16. **Historical landfill** in former Skedsmo municipality area — contamination status "unknown."
