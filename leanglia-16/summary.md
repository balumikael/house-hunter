## Condition Report — Issues to Watch ⚠️

### TG2 (Significant Deviations — Moderate Concern)

| Area | Issue |
|------|-------|
| **Roof covering (undertak)** | Past more than half of expected lifespan (~25-30 years). Increased leak risk. Full roof replacement needed eventually. |
| **Gutters & flashings** | Aging, given TG2 for age and wear. |
| **Wall cladding/construction** | No air gap behind wood panel (should have one). Nails driven too deep creating water traps. No mouse barrier behind panel. Panel/trim flush against window sills limiting ventilation. Cladding past half of longest expected lifespan (40-60 years). Diagonal crack in foundation wall visible via inspection hatch. |
| **Roof/loft structure** | Cannot be inspected (no access). TG2 given for age and risk of skewness, leaks, condensation. Higher heat loss expected. |
| **Windows (basement)** | Original 1984 windows — past expected lifespan. Higher heat loss, puncture/leak risk. |
| **Skylights** | Older date, need replacement. One skylight is punctured (confirmed by seller). |
| **Entry door** | Original, older date — past half lifespan. |
| **Terrace (1st floor)** | Structural dimensions and foundations not assessed. |
| **Below-ground rooms** | Rooms with walls under external ground level: bathroom and both laundry rooms. Risk construction for moisture. Moisture tested — normal readings, but ongoing risk. |
| **Drainage & foundation waterproofing** | Original from 1984 — past expected lifespan. Insufficient terrain slope toward building in some areas. Water pooling risk against foundation. |
| **Foundation walls** | Diagonal crack observed in inspection hatch in laundry room. Monitor for development. |
| **Water pipes** | Copper pipes of older date. Water pressure OK. |
| **Electrical system** | New fuse box (2022) but wiring is older. |
| **Ventilation** | Natural ventilation only. No mechanical extraction in wet rooms. |

### TG3 (Serious Deviations — Critical!) 🔴

| Area | Issue |
|------|-------|
| **1st Floor Bathroom** | **MUST BE FULLY RENOVATED.** Older date, past expected lifespan. Unknown membrane/waterproofing. Discolored/cracked silicone. Black mold on silicone. Holes visible under sink. Drain height insufficient (<25mm). Weak slope toward drain — water pooling risk. Hollow-sounding tiles (poor adhesion) causing cracked tiles/grout. Not designed for direct showering without proper membrane. Very high leak risk. |
| **Lower Floor Bathroom** | **MUST BE FULLY RENOVATED.** Same issues: older date, past lifespan, unknown membrane, discolored/cracked silicone, black mold, holes in walls, drain height insufficient, weak drain slope, hollow tiles causing cracks. Not designed for showering. Very high leak risk. |
| **Laundry Room (lower floor)** | **MUST BE FULLY RENOVATED.** Older date, vinyl flooring with curled edges clamped in drain. Pipe penetrations in wet zones lack proper sealing/collars — high moisture risk. Holes in walls, cracks in vinyl. Past half lifespan on floor construction, drain, and waterproofing. |
